some basic terminal commands like:

some additional git commands:

git init - to initialize, 
<br>
git remote add origin <link> - to target the repository in which we want to add files from local to remote, 
<br>
git remote -v - to check remote version/status, 
<br>
git branch - to check for branch, 
<br>
git branch -M main - to rename branch, 
<br>
git push origin main OR git push -u origin main - to tell the system that we will make changes to this file for a period of time so the -u creates an upstream link.
